# BiLT-Eur-2024
Supporting files for my presentation at [BILT Europe 2024](https://www.dbei.org/event-partner/bilt-europe-2024/) "An Engaging Domestic Asset Information Model In Notion". 

These Python scripts link the AIM in Notion to the model in Revit and are written to be deployed through [PyRevit](https://pyrevitlabs.notion.site/) and adopt the required folder structure for PyRevit, but could easily be adapted for other scenarios.

The accompanying Notion template can be duplicated from [here](https://thomascorrie.notion.site/Notion-Asset-Model-Template-460ada48170c4759997a70759bc84230?pvs=4).
